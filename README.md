# ransomeware
my first malware
to change the ip and port you need to modify the client side and server side to the same port (sorry for my english)
the feature are in my lenguage so blocca mean block and sblocca mean unlock 
step 1 
run the client side on the victim machine 
step 2 
run the server side on your machine if the server side say "conessione stabilita con (ip)" you are connected (the standar is your local 127.0.0.1
step 3 
the only 2 comands are sblocca and blocca
if every thing went well the victim machine was disabled compleatly and the only way of unlocking it is by writing sblocca
i made a feature (that you can freely remove) when shift f1 is presed the block removes itself  
(plz dont do crimes whit this there is no protection and the code is shit)
